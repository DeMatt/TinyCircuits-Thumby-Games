Are you one to remember the classic Wing Commander Games? 
Now is your time to jump into the cockpit on your Thumby. 
Dash through classic astroid fields and engage in dogfights with nether ending enemy ships in direct action mode.
The game includes 4 campaigns that take you back to the classic scenery and fights you might rememeber as I do.
You can change and extend the campaigns to your liking with a simple JSON structure defining each campaign (see respective readme)
Use the Settings Menu to understand and change controls
This would not have been possible without all the great graphic of the Wing Commander Encyclopedia Project. 

As the Thumby Colors is shipping now, watch out for the respective port!
v1.0: initial releaese
v1.1: added ability to fly through space, added afterburner, added Setting menu to configure input
v1.5: added Campaign Mode and improved my KnownSpace3DModel. Improved Afterburner and enabled full stop of the ship.
v1.6: (current_release) added support for ThumbyColor. Note that this is just enabling the grayscape version to run on the ThumbyColor. Performance is not great, but best I can get out of the machine. This is due to each frame needing to be converted bitwise to RGB565 and scaled up. Performnace will significantly increase with switch to native ThumbyColor support.
